# Proposal

## Summary
We are going to implement a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for defining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The DSL will be able to generate CUDA code based from Python, making use of cuDNN or cuBLAS. By developing a series of scheduling mechanisms, it will support efficient execution for different LSTM variants.
